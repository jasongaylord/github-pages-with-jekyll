During early builds of Visual Studio 2012, many developers griped and complained about the lack of color within the application. By the time VS2012 has RTMâ€™d, two themes shipped with VS2012. There is a light theme and a dark theme.

Recently, the Visual Studio team took this to a whole new level. Not only have they added additional UI update options to the Visual Studio customization options, but they now have seven new themes including a dark background with light editor, a light background with a dark editor, blue, red, purple, green, and tan.

Special thanks to the team for developing this. Hopefully they include it out of the box in a future service pack or other application update.
