Many workplaces and teams, mine included, recommend that employees turn on video to keep some sort of normalcy to the day. However, you may not have a nice clean office space at your house. So, want to hide the clutter or blank out the kids that are burning down the house behind you? Here are tutorials for the most popular video streaming services and how you can hide your background:

*   Zoom - [https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/210707503-Virtual-Background](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/210707503-Virtual-Background)
*   Microsoft Teams - [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/change-your-background-for-a-teams-meeting-f77a2381-443a-499d-825e-509a140f4780](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/change-your-background-for-a-teams-meeting-f77a2381-443a-499d-825e-509a140f4780 "https://jasong.us/2xz9tJu")
*   Webex - [https://help.webex.com/en-us/80jduab/Webex-Meetings-Change-Your-Video-Background](https://help.webex.com/en-us/80jduab/Webex-Meetings-Change-Your-Video-Background)

There are also services you can subscribe to, such as [ChromaCam](https://jasong.us/2RJ1oss), if your video conferencing software does not have a method of blocking out the background.
