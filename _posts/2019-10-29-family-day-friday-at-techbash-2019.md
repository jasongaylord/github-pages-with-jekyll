[TechBash 2019](https://techbash.com/) is not only the best place in the Northeast to get the best [developer content](https://techbash.com/sessions), we have the best content for the whole family! Check out this year's Family Friday agenda:

##### Take a Break! Martial Arts / Board Breaking (Ages 5+)

Ever wanted to chop firewood with your bare hands? While we wonâ€™t be splitting logs you will get some exercise with an overview of some martial arts techniques. You will then have a chance to test your new skills and break some boards. Take home an awesome new souvenir from the Kalahari: your own kindling! This session will require hands-on physical participation but does not require any previous martial arts experience.

##### Reptile Show

Join [PT Reptiles](https://ptreptilespa.com/) for a LIVE reptile show! Pete will bring a wide assortment of reptiles, and some arachnids, too!

##### Application Development Workshop (Hands-On Lab - Ages 11(ish) and up)

Please come prepared with a laptop running a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari). This is a hands-on session and will require typing.  
Powered by [TechGirlz](https://www.techgirlz.org/).

##### Engineering Challenge (For kids age 8(ish) and up)

Challenge details provided at TechBash.  
Competitors will work in teams. Up to 4 teams will be able to participate. Teams will be provided with a K'Nex kit to use for the project. Teams will have up to 2 hours to plan and build their projects. No external pieces may be brought to the competition. Each team will need to prepare a presentation (max 2 minutes) on their model and how they answered the challenge.

##### Scavenger Hunt
