If you are doing any scripting or integrating using GUIDs and/or resource names, you may want to pay attention. Azure is changing the GUIDs and resource names for several service types on December 1st. Here is a list of whatâ€™s known so far:

*   [Bandwidth Data Tranfer In/Out](https://jasong.us/2FeTVxt)
*   [Blob Storage](https://jasong.us/2zPT6Wf)
*   [SQL Database Managed Instance](https://jasong.us/2PnfJvG)

In addition, prices will be changing for many other services and in most cases, will be decreasing.
