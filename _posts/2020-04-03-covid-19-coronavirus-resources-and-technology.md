I've been working remote for over 2 weeks now. I'm used to working remote, but not quite to the degree I am now. There are a bunch of new challenges as a result including having more people in the household. So, this has inspired me to start writing regular posts with some tips and tricks for working remote, using technology to help solve the challenges we're facing in "the new norm", and helpful links to help provide solutions to some common challenges. 

Remember, during this time of social distancing, we need to make sure that we stay healthy, both physically and mentally. We're all in this together.

### Helpful Tips to Stay Safe

Here are a few helpful tips to stay safe during this time. Several of these tips are good to follow every day regardless of what's going on in the world. If you have helpful tips that you'd like me to include, please leave a comment or send me a message on Twitter [@jgaylord](https://twitter.com/jgaylord).

1.  **Stay Home** - If you must go shopping, only one person in the household should be out and
        shopping. It's also best that the same person handles the shopping. Be sure to keep your distance and follow the
        recommended 6 feet (or roughly 2 meters) distance from others. Also, if you do have to go out, limit your trips.
        Try going only weekly.

2.  **Keep Your Distance** - Whether you are shopping or spending time outside getting fresh air, be
        sure to follow the recommendation for safe distancing. The general recommendation is 6 feet, or roughly 2
        meters, from others.

3.  **Wash Your Hands for 20 Seconds** - As Pennsylvania Secretary of Health, Dr Rachel Levine reminds
        Pennsylvanians during every press conference, wash your hands for 20 seconds which is roughly the amount of time
        needed to sing Happy Birthday twice. 

4.  **Keep Packages Outside** - When shopping online or heading to the grocery store, you are bound to
        get items that are in cardboard, paper, or plastic. Be sure to keep packages and non-perishables outside or in
        your garage (if possible) for at least 48 hours. The virus can survive on surfaces and this is just an extra
        step to help keep it out of your house or living space.

5.  **Don't Stock Up for the Apocalypse** -  Be mindful of others and only pick up what you feel
        you'll need between the time you are shopping and you're next visit. There are shortages of food, household
        supplies, and medical supplies.

6.  **Leave Shoes Outside** - If you are traveling to areas, such as to the store, where someone could
        have had the virus and coughed, the moisture droplets could be on the store floor and you could be bringing them
        into your house. This may seem like an extreme measure, but generally speaking, shoes carry a lot of germs to
        begin with. This will help keep your family safe.

7.  **Don't Touch your Face** - This is tough for many individuals, myself included. Just keep in mind
        that the virus can enter through your eyes, nose and mouth and that's about it. So, if you limit or eliminate
        touching your face, you have a better chance of staying healthy.

8.  **Stop Smoking or Vaping** - Sure, this is an addiction and is easier said than done. But COVID-19
        is a respiratory virus. Cutting back or quitting may be enough to help your lungs should you contract the virus.

9.  **Masks and Gloves Help** - Wearing cloth masks won't prevent you from getting it. However, if you
        have it, whether you know it or not, it can help prevent others from getting it. Don't run to your local store
        looking for masks. Leave those for the medical professionals in the unlikely chance that the store is carrying
        them. Instead, use a scarf or bandana to cover your mouth. If you wear some type of glove, be sure to take them
        off inside out. You should dispose the gloves, but if you can't, wash under high temps.

10.  **Wipe Down Surfaces Often** - Be sure to wipe down light switches, door knobs, counters, and other
        surfaces often. If you don't have Lysol or Clorox wipes, you can mix 4 teaspoons of Clorox with 1 quart of
        water. Be careful which solutions you use on electronics. You should not spray directly on electronics nor
        should you use a cloth that is saturated as you'll not only destroy the bacteria, but you'll also destroy the
        electronics.

11.  **Cover Coughs with your Elbow** - Do not cover your coughs with your hand, but rather your elbow.
        This will help to prevent moisture droplets to land on your hand and have you inadvertently touching objects.
