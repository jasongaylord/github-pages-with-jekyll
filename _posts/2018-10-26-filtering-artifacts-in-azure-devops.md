Azure DevOps is currently undergoing a facelift. If you are using the new design and you leverage the Package Management (Artifacts) option in Azure DevOps:

If you’re using NPM, you may notice that the default view is to show all packages in the list including those found at npmjs.

However, if you choose the Source dropdown menu, you can choose ‘This Feed’ to see only your packages that you’ve uploaded.

Early this year, [I blogged](https://jasong.us/2PteeLu) about automatically pushing versioned NuGet packages to the Azure DevOps Artifacts (Package Management) feed using the Azure DevOps build process. If this is of interest, I’d highly recommend reading [that post](https://jasong.us/2PteeLu). It’s available at [https://www.jasongaylord.com/blog/automatically-push-versioned-nuget-packages-using-vsts-build-process](https://jasong.us/2PteeLu "https://jasong.us/2PteeLu").
