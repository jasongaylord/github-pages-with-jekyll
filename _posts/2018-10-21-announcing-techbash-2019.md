The TechBash Foundation has announced that [TechBash 2019](https://jasong.us/techbash) will take place November 12th-15th, 2019 at the Kalahari Resort & Convention Center in Pocono Manor, PA. Much like 2018, TechBash will begin with a day of pre-conference workshops on the latest topics. The event will also have events for families. A full schedule will be announced in the Summer of 2019. If you are interested in speaking at the event, the Call for Speakers will be announced in early 2019. You can also post a message here if you have any questions. If you’re interested in sponsoring or are interested in group sales, feel free to contact me. You can also keep in touch with TechBash by signing up for [their newsletter](https://jasong.us/tbnewsletter) and following them [on Twitter](https://jasong.us/tbtwitter).

Haven’t been to TechBash? We extend a hand to you, especially those of you who haven’t attended a developer conference before or may feel excluded at tech events. TechBash is for everyone, and we’re going to have loads of fun while we learn a ton.

At TechBash we inspire our attendees to build great things that will change the world. The sessions at TechBash will deliver bleeding edge advances in the coding, designing and development of mobile, web, desktop and SaaS applications. Our [speakers](https://jasong.us/tbspeakers) are world class knowledge experts you may have seen featured at other conferences like DevIntersections, NDC, VS Live (Visual Studio Live), and Google I/O. We keep adding an inclusive variety of speakers to the list, so check back regularly to see who’s up next. 

We’ve built a safe, welcoming and exciting environment that is designed for *all* attendees to get the most out of the event. In the many, many informative sessions at TechBash, you’ll learn a crazy number of new things, but we know amazing interactions happen outside the talks too. Our attendee lounge will have plenty of space for you to hang out and talk with old friends and make new ones. Speakers and attendees will gather in the lounge to follow up talks after sessions over coffee and snacks. Our awesome, big name vendors will be there, presenting their latest gadgets and code, and a few job listings as well. 

Our venue, the Kalahari Resort, is really cool. It is a recently expanded resort, conference center and 220,000 sq. ft. indoor water park, now the largest in the country. The Kalahari is located in the beautiful Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, less than a 2-hour drive from New York City, Philadelphia, and northern NJ. This location is still within reasonable driving distance of many other cities in the northeast. Many developer conferences require a cross-country flight and thousands of dollars to attend. Some are even invitation-only. TechBash is different. We're in your backyard, our tickets are a fraction of the cost of those other conferences, and all are welcome. Yet, we have several of the same speakers and sessions. 

We look forward to seeing you there!
