#### 2. Location, Location, Location

Our venue, the [Kalahari Resort](http://www.kalahariresorts.com/pennsylvania) is really cool. It’s a new Resort, Conference Center, and 100,000 sq. ft. indoor waterpark! TechBash is located in the Pocono Mountains in PA. That means it’s not only a beautiful setting, but it’s also really close. If you are in the northeast US and tired of flying cross country for tech conferences, TechBash is for you. **We are less than a 2-hour drive from New York City, Philadelphia, and northern NJ**. And this location is still within reasonable driving distance of many other major cities in the northeast, including Boston, Pittsburgh, Baltimore and Washington, DC!
