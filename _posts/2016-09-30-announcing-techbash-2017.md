First of all, on behalf of all of the organizers of TechBash 2016, we’d like to thank you for attending the event. We hope you enjoyed it and look forward to seeing you next year.

Earlier today, we announced that TechBash 2017 will be on October 4-6, 2017 at the Kalahari Resort and Convention Center in Pocono Manor, PA. We’ll be announcing more details shortly including the best pricing possible for the event. So, expect early bird announcements in the next few weeks. Unlike this year where we offered sale prices off and on leading up to the event, we <u>will not</u> be doing this for TechBash 2017.

Thanks and we’ll see you next year!
