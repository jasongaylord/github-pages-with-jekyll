If you were unaware, I’m one of the founding board members of TechBash, a developer conference found in Northeastern Pennsylvania. Over the past three months, we’ve started ramping up our planning for our next event at the Kalahari Resorts in Pocono Manor from November 12-15, 2019. As always, all of our information is available at [https://techbash.com](https://jasong.us/techbash). 

As founders, we’re a bunch of geeks that love development and are always fighting our inner desire to build something new and fresh. This year, we couldn’t hold that desire back and have designed and developed a refreshed website that’s more responsive, cleaner, and easier to use. We hope you agree and can find it easier to learn more about the event. Here’s a preview of what it looks like:

Please be sure to stop by and check it out. We’d love to hear feedback either through comments on this post, [the official announcement](https://jasong.us/2tGHtOI) of our new site on the TechBash news page, or any of our social media accounts.
