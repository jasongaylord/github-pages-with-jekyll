How many times have you wanted to drop a selection of Microsoft SQL Server tables that have begin with some common characters? I have many times especially when Iâ€™m testing certain web applications, such as Orchard CMS, and using different database prefix values to switch between instances. Thanks to [](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/curth/)[Curt Hagenlocher](http://jasong.us/UJWppw) over at a [](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4393/sql-server-drop-all-tables-whose-names-begin-with-a-certain-string)[StackOverflow post](http://jasong.us/UJWt8T), I now can.

This can easily be updated to include views, stored procedures, and functions.
