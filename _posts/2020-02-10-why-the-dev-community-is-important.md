DeveloperMedia posted my interview with [Jeffrey Fritz](https://jasong.us/fritz) from a couple of months ago at TechBash. You can read the full post at [https://developermedia.com/developer-community/](https://jasong.us/2ULXDVL) and catch the full interview:

During the interview, I was asked how I discover content about a tool Iâ€™m using, where do I go for deeper content, and where the best places are to find tutorials and how to content.
