Did you know that you can learn how to use git, how to become an open source company, what GitHub Actions are and even how to host a static website through GitHub using Jekyll? You can do all this using the GitHub Learning Lab. To get started, visit [https://lab.github.com/install](https://lab.github.com/install "https://jasong.us/2KJpL5G"). You’ll notice that it will want to choose repositories for you to install the Learning Lab. I recommend creating a new repository just for the lab. Once the lab is installed, you’ll be able to use the GitHub Learning Lab. The github-learning-lab bot will track your progress so you can always come back to it. Along the way, it leverages GitHub by automatically creating issues, pull-requests, and repositories.
